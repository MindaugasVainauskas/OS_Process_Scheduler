##OS_Process_Scheduler
This is a simple sumulator application of processes wait times in the CPU queue when different waiting algorithms are implemented. This was 
a lab submission for Operating Systems 1 module in first semester of Year 3 of the Computing in Software Development course, GMIT-2016. The purpose
of the application is to see how different scheduling algorithms affect queue of processes waiting times and average waiting time of the entire 
queue.

####Scheduling algorithms used
1. FCFS - First Come First Served;
2. SJF - Shortest Job First;
3. RR - Round Robin
